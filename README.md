# Fractional-Feature-Selection.-Evaluating-Features-Predictive-Power
In a Machine Learning process, we need the Feature engineering and Preprocessing stages before training on the main mode. This repository approaches the Feature Selection based on 1-dimensional decision tree classifiers on (default) datasets to specifying the features predictive power for having relevant features.
