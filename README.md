# Fractional Feature Selection. Evaluating Features Predictive Power
In a Machine Learning process, we need the Feature engineering and Preprocessing stages before training on the main mode. This repository approaches the Feature Selection based on 1-dimensional decision tree classifiers on (default) datasets to specifying the features predictive power for having relevant features.

In a Machine Learning process, the Feature engineering stage involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the model. This can include techniques such as one-hot encoding, scaling, normalization, and creating interaction terms. Preprocessing, on the other hand, involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing outliers. These stages are crucial as they directly impact the quality of the input data for the machine learning model.

Feature selection is an important step in the machine learning pipeline as it helps improve model performance by identifying and using only the most relevant features for prediction. The use of 1-dimensional decision tree classifiers for feature selection is a popular approach as it provides a simple and interpretable way to measure the importance of each feature. By using decision trees, we can calculate the feature importance scores based on how much each feature improves the purity of the nodes in the tree.

ðŸ’¡ The process of using 1-dimensional decision tree classifiers for feature selection involves training a decision tree on each individual feature and then ranking the features based on their corresponding decision tree's performance. This allows us to identify the features with the highest predictive power and select them for further model training. By specifying the features' predictive power, we can focus on building models with only the most informative features, leading to improved model interpretability and generalization performance.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we can apply it to (default) datasets and evaluate the performance of the selected features. By using decision tree classifiers for feature selection, we can obtain a ranked list of features based on their importance scores. This allows us to understand which features have the most influence on the target variable and should be included in the model. Additionally, we can compare the model performance with and without feature selection (1.0 fraction of features) to assess the impact of using only the relevant features.

By measuring the predictive power of each feature, we can improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where datasets contain a large number of features, as it allows us to focus on building models with only the most informative attributes.
